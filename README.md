# Text Summarizer App


This is a ML task, where a simple web application is designed to summarize any text paragraph provided in the input field. Initially started as privacy policy summarizer app project and because of data unavailability, I designed it as a summarizer AI. However, the fact can't be neglected that privacy, policy terms are also long boring but important texts and with proper training data a good model can be built to save time and people can be aware about any products or services. My concept is a simple ai summarizer tool along with summarizer chatbot(chatbot just to summarize policies and T&C) integrated into the page of Privacy policy/T&C page which can help companies gain trust with their customer and makes people aware about using any service/products with precaution, without going through those long boring texts which almost everybody skip.

Since, initial plan for the project was to just create a simple app to summarize long texts from privacy policy, T&C but somehow it ended up being a simple Text Summarizer App. That is why I also created a simple good looking react ui frontend to interact with backend(flask). And also a streamlit ui based web app to interact with the model. Development and workflow of this project is presented here.
